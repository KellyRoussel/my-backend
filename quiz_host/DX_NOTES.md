# Developer notes: ElevenLabs Agents SDK

An honest log of building Quiz Host on ElevenLabs Agents: what was easy, where it hurt,
and what I would change. I updated it during development.

**Versions:** `@elevenlabs/client` 1.26.0 (browser) and the `elevenlabs` Python SDK 2.71.0,
whose types I used to build the agent-creation payload.

**How I worked:** the documentation site was not reachable from my sandboxed dev
environment, so I worked from the published packages themselves: the npm README, the
`.d.ts` files and the compiled `dist/`, plus the Python SDK's generated types. That turned
out to be a useful test in itself: how far can you get with only what ships in the
package? Everything that depends on a live voice session is listed at the end under
**To verify live**. Those points stay open until they are measured on a real game.

## What was simple

- **One call to start.** `Conversation.startSession({ conversationToken, connectionType: "webrtc", clientTools, ...callbacks })`
  is the whole integration surface. The session config is a discriminated union
  (`PublicSessionConfig | PrivateWebRTCSessionConfig | PrivateWebSocketSessionConfig`, with
  `never` on the forbidden fields), so mixing `agentId` with `conversationToken`, or a
  signed URL with WebRTC, fails at compile time. Good API design.
- **Client tools are plain async functions.** `clientTools: { submit_verdict: async ({ playerId, correct }) => ... }`.
  A thrown error is sent back to the agent as `is_error: true` with the message. That made
  self-correction easy: the game server's French error messages ("Ce n'est pas ce joueur
  qui a la main. C'est Léa.") go straight to the LLM.
- **The primitives a room-mic app needs exist.** `setMicMuted`, `sendUserMessage`,
  `sendContextualUpdate`, `setVolume`, and `onModeChange` (speaking / listening). That last
  one gave me a free "the agent finished reading the question" signal to start the buzz
  countdown.
- **No bundler required.** The package ships an IIFE build (`dist/lib.iife.js`, global
  `ElevenLabsClient`), so a vanilla-JS page can load a pinned version from a CDN.
- **Private agents are easy to secure.** One server-side `GET /v1/convai/conversation/token?agent_id=…`
  with `xi-api-key`, and the browser only ever sees a short-lived token.

## Friction points

1. **Tool return type vs runtime.** `ClientToolsConfig` types tool results as
   `string | number | void`, but `handleClientToolCall` runs `JSON.stringify` on objects
   anyway. Returning an object, the natural thing for game state, works at runtime but is a
   type error, so TypeScript users end up stringifying by hand. *Suggestion:* type the result
   as any JSON-serialisable value and document the serialisation.
2. **Silent default tool result.** A tool that returns `undefined` reports
   `"Client tool execution successful."` to the agent. That is sensible, but it is only
   visible in the compiled code. *Suggestion:* document it next to `clientTools`.
3. **Two sources of truth for tools.** A client tool must be declared on the agent (in the
   dashboard or the API) *and* implemented in `clientTools`, and nothing checks that they
   match. A typo shows up only when the LLM calls the tool mid-conversation. I added a test
   that compares `agent-config.json` with the host page's tool map. *Suggestion:* on
   connect, warn in the console about tools declared on the agent but missing on the
   client.
4. **No JSDoc on the key methods.** `sendContextualUpdate` and `sendUserMessage` have no
   doc comments in the `.d.ts`. Their names suggest "silent context" vs "triggers a turn",
   but whether `sendUserMessage` **interrupts** an agent that is currently speaking is not
   stated. A quiz needs exactly that: someone buzzes mid-question. I added a client-side
   workaround that ducks the agent's volume to 0 until its next turn starts.
   *Suggestion:* an explicit `conversation.interrupt()`, plus one sentence on each
   method's interruption semantics.
5. **Muted mic and turn-taking.** The app keeps the mic muted for up to 20 s while players
   think. `TurnConfig.turn_timeout` ("Maximum wait time for the user's reply before
   re-engaging the user") and `silence_end_call_timeout` document neither units, ranges
   nor how to disable them, so I could not tell from the types whether a long muted
   silence makes the agent re-engage or end the call. *Suggestion:* a documented
   "push-to-talk / app-driven turns" recipe, since it is a common pattern for kiosks, games
   and noisy rooms.
6. **Similar token models.** The Python SDK has both `TokenResponseModel { token, conversation_id }`
   (what `GET /v1/convai/conversation/token` returns, and what the JS SDK reads as
   `data.token`) and `ConversationTokenResponseModel { agent_id, conversation_token }`.
   When you write the token endpoint by hand, it is easy to pick the wrong field.
7. **Naming drift.** The same product appears as `convai` (API paths), `conversational_ai`
   (Python SDK), "Agents Platform" and "ElevenAgents" (npm README). It is fine once you
   know, but it slows down searching for answers.
8. **Creating an agent by code is now two steps.** `prompt.tools` is marked "use tool_ids
   instead", so you first create each tool (`POST /v1/convai/tools`), then the agent with
   the ids. It is clean for reuse but heavier for a quickstart. `quiz_host/agent/create_agent.py`
   wraps it.
9. **Silent model-dependent flags.** `expressive_mode` is "automatically disabled for non-v3
   models". It would be friendlier if the API returned a warning when the flag is set on a
   model that ignores it.

## To verify live

Measured on real games with the debug panel (`D` on the host screen, which logs WebSocket
events and tool calls with timestamps). The "BUZZ via contextual update" switch in that
panel compares both methods.

| Question | Result |
|---|---|
| `sendUserMessage("BUZZ: …")`: delay from buzz to the agent's first audio | _to measure_ |
| `sendContextualUpdate("BUZZ: …")`: does the agent react without a user turn? | _to measure_ |
| Does `sendUserMessage` cut an agent that is still reading the question? | _to measure_ |
| With the mic muted for 20 s, does the agent re-engage or end the call? | _to measure_ |
| Are `[sarcastic]` / `[laughs]` tags rendered in French with `eleven_v3_conversational`? | _to measure_ |
| Does `create_agent.py` work against the live API as written? | _to run_ |
